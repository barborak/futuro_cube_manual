##  Exception clause to the Apache License version 2.0

As a special exception to the Apache License 2.0 (and referring to the definitions in Section 1 of that license), you may link, statically or dynamically, the ”Work” to other modules to produce an executable file containing portions of the ”Work”, and distribute that executable file in ”Object” form under the terms of your choice, without any of the additional requirements listed in Section 4 of the Apache License 2.0. This exception applies only to redistributions in ”Object” form (not ”Source” form) and only if no modifications have been made to the ”Work”.
