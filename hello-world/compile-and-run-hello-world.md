# Compile and Run Hello World

* Set the file as Selected SCRIPT:

![](/assets/selectedScript.jpg)

* And now press **Compile and Upload to RAM** \(later get detailed info at [Compiling, uploading and erasing scripts](/compiling-uploading-scripts.md)\), output should look like this \(we can exact compiler invoke commands and results\):

```
$>
Run:
"D:\Programs\Rubik'sFuturoCubeSuite-SC1.8\bin\pawncc.exe" "hello.p" -i. -O3 -d1 -S512
Result:
"D:\Programs\Rubik'sFuturoCubeSuite-SC1.8\bin\pawncc.exe" "hello.p" -i. -O3 -d1 -S512

Compiling is done.
File length: 192 B, free RAM mem: 8192 B
Upload file: C:\RFC\hello.amx, sd:99
$>
```

We just have sucessfully compiled **hello.p** to **hello.amx** and uploaded to RAM memory of the cube. Now we should run the program. We have 2 options and we will show you both. The **second one** is the most widely used.

### 1. by shell command

If the script has been uploaded into RAM, we can simply use command [prun](/interactive-shell/prun.md):

```
$>prun

TBD - picture from CorelDraw

As you can see our only text output **"hello world"** is a bit hidden in many other information, which we do not need to pay attention now, but on the top side of the cube, there should be square.

### 2. by RFCSuite - most common for development

![](/assets/run_and_stop.jpg)

If you check options above \(**run after upload** and **stop script before compile**\), you get very nice and automated flow. Because if the script has been compiled without errors, it is automatically uploaded either for RAM of FLASH and immediately started. We do recommend to check as well **stop script before compile**, this is very useful. If the previously running script has some extensive text outputs, you might miss what is giong on during compilation...
