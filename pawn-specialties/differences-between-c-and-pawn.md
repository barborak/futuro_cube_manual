# Differences between C and PAWN

If you know how to program in C, than program in PAWN is like being at your second home. However there are couple differences to keep in mind. Next list shows most important of them to make life easier:

* there is no need for **;** at the end of line
* PAWN has [Packed and unpacked](/pawn-specialties/packed-and-unpacked-strings.md) strings and arrays
* Only 2 dim arrays are possible
* There is only one type - cell, it is like 32 bit signed integer
* Functions can have [Default parameters](/pawn-specialties/default-parameters.md)
* TBD, const, call by refernce etc...
