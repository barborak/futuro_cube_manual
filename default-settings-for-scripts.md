## Default settings for scripts

Every time a script is run, it has to set up many defaults parameters. Once something is set in a script, it becomes standard until changed again.

These defaults have been selected to serve most common situations. Even some colors are set up as active. So, in the beginning, it is not necessary to check if everything has correct values.
