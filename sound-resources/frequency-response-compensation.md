## Frequency response compensation

We can add a nice touch to the process of sound preparation.
Due to the mechanical and physical properties of the speaker in the cube, the frequency response is not perfectly flat.
But we can compensate for it by applying a compensation filter to the sound.

This is the frequency response of non-compensating sweep from 10 Hz to 10 kHz:
