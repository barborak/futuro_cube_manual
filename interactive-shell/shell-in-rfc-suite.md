## Shell in RFC Suite

SDK view in RFC Suite offers direct access to the cube shell. Everything is set and ready to go as soon as you switch to this mode. You can test all available shell commands very easily there.

**It is important to mention, that RFC Suite turns ON multiplexed packet mode and does not turn it OFF!
Therefore this must be kept in mind if other proprietary apps wants to access the shell right after the cube has been connected to RFC Suite.**
