## Ram

In this area, scripts are sharing data, code and stack.

It is very useful for testing some functions or even whole scripts.

If possible, it is recommended to test a script in this area and (if) when it works, upload it to flash.

The size limitation is 11 KBytes including stack and data, which should be more than enough for most of your initial work.

RFCSuite has one button that automatically compiles, uploads and runs the selected script, so you can work pretty fast. If you need to test something where the USB cable would create an obstacle, you donâ€™t have to upload your script into flash. If it is stored in RAM, simply unplug the USB cable and the script will restart automatically. Plugging the cable back in will erase the script.
