## Erasing scripts

Scripts in RAM are automatically erased each time the USB cable is plugged in. Scripts in the Flash or MyCube area can be erased in several ways:

* Using command `pawnerase` from the shell erases all areas, i.e Ram, Flash, and MyCube
* In Rubik’s Futuro Cube from version 0.6 pressing  either ”Erase FLASH” or ”Erase MYCUBE” buttons
* From FW 4.5 there are two new commands: `pawneraseflash` and `pawnerasemycube`
