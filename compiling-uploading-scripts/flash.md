## Flash

Scripts in flash may be 30 KBytes long (50 KBytes from FW 4.5) and use data and stack in the whole RAM section (11Kbytes).

This is the main area for storing and running big scripts. If the cube is unplugged, scripts can be started from it's ICON, which can be specified in it's code. Otherwise, it creates a default ICON in the blue menu (from FW 4.5 in white menu).
