## WaitMelodyOver

Wait until current melody in progress is over

Syntax: `WaitMelodyOver()`

Notes: This function blocks the program until current melody playback is over. It differs from the [previous function](/api-native-functions/waitmelodyover.md), because melody playback can be paused, which would appear as the playback is over, in which case the previous function would be used

Example: `WaitMelodyOver()`
