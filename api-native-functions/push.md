## Push

Push array into [Push Pop Array](/push-pop-arrays.md)

Syntax: `Push(arr[],ppindex=0,size=sizeof arr)`

* `arr` array that is going to be pushed in
* `ppindex` index of available PPArray arbiter &lt;0...3&gt;
* `size` size of pushed array

Returns: Returns 1 if operation was successful, otherwise an exception is raised.

Notes: If the Push Pop Array is full, simply the oldest items are thrown away and lost. This must be considered as a possible effect to be aware of.

Example:

* `Push(arr)`, push arr into initialized array with index 0
* `Push(temp,1)`, push temp into initialized array with index 1
