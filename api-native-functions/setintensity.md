## SetIntensity

Set current intensity for all color components

Syntax: `SetIntensity(value)`( value represent current intensity in range)

Notes: Each color component when drawn onto the canvas is scaled by the intensity number. 256 means means no scaling. The default value, which is set when the script starts, is 128. This value reflects full and correct display of several preset colors.

Example: `SetIntensity(30)`
