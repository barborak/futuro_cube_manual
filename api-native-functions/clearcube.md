## ClearCube

Clear all RGB LEDs on the cube

Syntax: `ClearCube()`

Notes: The visible result is the same as if `ClearCanvas()` and `PrintCanvas()` were called. However, the virtual canvas is not modified. This function is useful as the example with [FlashCanvas](/api-native-functions/flashcanvas.md), because it accesses the cube's surface directly.

Example: `ClearCube()`
