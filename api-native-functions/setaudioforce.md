## SetAudioForce

Enables forcing audio to channel 0

Syntax: `SetAudioForce(value)`

* `value` 1 - enables audio force, 0 - disables audio force

Notes: This function can enable audio force on channel zero. After enabling, channel zero is not used for overriding when a new [play](/api-native-functions/play.md) command is invoked. It is used to force play audio data in a situation where more resources are mixed and one sound must be completely played without interruption. To use channel zero with forcing function, `Play` must have a song name with the beginning character `@`

Example:

* `SetAudioForce(1)`
* `Play("@forcesong")`
