## SetStillClick

Enables or disables the still click feature

Syntax: `SetStillClick(value)`

* `value` 1 - enables, 0 - disables (default)

Notes: Still click feature, if enabled, waits for the cube to be still before any motion is recognized. In such cases, the user usually does not do any phantom ”clicks” when for example transfers the cube from hand to hand, but before tapping, he must hold the cube very still.

Example:

* `SetStillClick(1)`
